# LiveWell Coach Foundry Workshop: Facilitator Run of Show

**Format:** one day, 9:00–5:30, agenda fixed by HPB. **Rails:** 🟢 Navigator (portal) and 🔵 Builder
(Python cells). **Outcome:** every participant builds the same LiveWell Coach, grounds it in Foundry IQ,
governs it, personalises it on Resident 360, and sees it answer Mei's programme question through the
Fabric data agent the cohort built in the Fabric workshop.

All prompts are referenced by `prompt_id` from [content/prompts/test-prompts.json](content/prompts/test-prompts.json).
All figures come from `python scripts/r360.py` (and, from Phase 3b, `scripts/validate-narrative.py`), never from a portal run.

## Facilitator stance

- Two seats, one coach. **Rahim** (RESIDENT_00061, 61, Woodlands, North) asks citizen questions →
  Foundry IQ + profile + memory. **Mei Lin** (programme officer) asks population questions → the Fabric IQ tool.
  Mei is the only reason the coach ever calls Fabric.
- Arc: Fabric **Unify → Govern → Personalise → Converse**; today Foundry adds **Coach & Act**. See
  [content/narrative/rahim.md](content/narrative/rahim.md).
- Vocabulary is fixed by [content/config/glossary.yaml](content/config/glossary.yaml): MVPA, Healthpoints/eVouchers,
  disengaged, hazy (PSI ≥ 55, regional proxy). Use it exactly.
- The coach never diagnoses, never doses medication and never shows another resident's data.

## T-0 checklist (07:30–08:45)

| Check | How | Pass |
|---|---|---|
| Fabric capacity resumed | `bash scripts/capacity.sh resume <env>` (see [ADMIN-SETUP](content/admin/ADMIN-SETUP.md)) | Capacity **Active** in Fabric admin portal |
| Values sheet on screen | `python scripts/render-values.py` → `content/config/values.md` (gitignored) | Project endpoint + agent names visible |
| Reference agents alive | Open the `livewell-demo-*` agents (`agent_naming.demo_agents` in `content/config/workshop.yaml`), send `lab0_hi` to `livewell-demo-lab0` | Introduces itself, says it is not a doctor |
| Fabric tool alive | Send `fabric_q_disengaged_regions` to `livewell-demo-fabric` | Trace shows the Fabric IQ call; North ranks first |
| Knowledge base alive | Send `lab1_prediabetes_eat` to `livewell-demo-kb` | ≥ 1 citation to `lg-05-eating-for-pre-diabetes` |
| MCP alive | `GET /health` on `ca-mcp-activities-<env>` | 200 |
| Demo videos ready | `demos/videos/<lab>-<date>.webm` from `python demos/record-demos.py` (T-1) open in a local player | Plays offline |
| Smoke test | `python scripts/smoke-test.py --demo-agents` | 11/11 PASS (includes the guardrail drift check, the demo-memory residue check and the A2A specialists check) |
| Demo memory clean | `python scripts/reset-demo-memory.py` (`--reset` if it flags residue after a red team) | Exit 0, 0 flagged |
| Wi-Fi slide | SSID/code from `content/config/workshop.yaml` | Correct values (TODO until confirmed) |

## Morning: L100, everyone (9:00–12:15)

| Time | Block | Facilitation notes | Demo prompt(s) | Checkpoint to move on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9:00 | What is Microsoft Foundry (30) | New Foundry portal tour: models, agents, tools, observability, governance. "Where we left off": the Fabric arc, then "today we add Coach & Act". | — | Room can name the four Fabric arc steps and the new fifth one |
| 9:30 | Foundry Models (20) | Catalogue, Global Standard, quota, TPM caps, reasoning effort. Why two models: `gpt-5-mini` at Low reasoning effort for Labs 0-2, `gpt-4.1-mini` from Lab 3 because not every model supports every tool (OpenAPI, A2A, Fabric). Open a trace and read the model and tokens. | `lab0_am_i_diabetic` | Room can say why the Lab 3 coach changes model |
| 9:50 | Foundry Agent Service (25) | Agent = model + instructions (+ tools). Managed runtime, versions, multi-agent, memory, frameworks. Build LiveWell Coach live; show a structured output. | `lab0_hi`, `lab0_am_i_diabetic` | Agent states it is not a doctor and refuses to diagnose |
| 10:15 | **Micro-Lab 0** (15, all rails, portal) | Everyone creates `livewell-<initials>`, pastes the `base` instructions block from [coach-instructions.md](content/prompts/coach-instructions.md), sets Reasoning effort to Low, removes Web search if the template added it, sends two prompts and reads the trace. [Lab 0](content/labs/lab-00.md). | `lab0_hi`, `lab0_am_i_diabetic` | ≥ 80% of the room shows the refusal to diagnose. Stragglers pair with a neighbour |
| 10:30 | Break (15) | Helpers triage sign-in, Authenticator and RBAC. | — | — |
| 10:45 | Tools & Knowledge (30) | Foundry IQ knowledge base on Azure AI Search (agentic retrieval, citations, refusal on absence), connectors, MCP, the Fabric IQ tool. **Two IQs on Rahim:** guide question with citation, then Mei's region question via their own Fabric data agent. | `lab1_prediabetes_eat`, `lab1_supplement`, `fabric_q_disengaged_regions` | Room can say which IQ answered which question |
| 11:15 | Control Plane: "CIO lab" (40) | Guardrails (input/output/tool), tracing, monitoring, evaluation, red teaming, identity (Entra Agent ID), cost tracking. Trip a guardrail, open the trace, show eval and red-team scorecards. Stress the Foundry User ceiling. | `lab2_medication_double`, `lab2_injected_flyer`, `lab2_benign_control` | Each table names **one policy they would require before production** |
| 11:55 | Platform architecture (20) | "Two IQs, one agent" diagram: their medallion on the left, Foundry on the right. Map all ten patterns to labs (README table). | — | — |
| 12:15 | Lunch (60) | Announce: the afternoon is L200–L300, Builder cells start at Lab 1. | — | — |

### CIO framing for the Control Plane

Identity decides who can build; RBAC decides who can publish; guardrails decide what the agent may attempt;
evaluators decide whether behaviour is acceptable; traces make it auditable. Participants hold **Foundry User**:
they can build and run agents but cannot deploy models, create connections or publish hosted agents.

## Afternoon: L200–L300 (1:15–5:30)

| Time | Block | Lab mapping | Demo prompt(s) | Checkpoint to move on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1:15 | Agent Framework & multi-agent (40) | SDK agents, versioning, orchestration patterns. [Lab 1](content/labs/lab-01.md) walkthrough (Builder: KB MCP connection in code, JSON contract), with a preview of Lab 3 code. | `lab1_prediabetes_eat`, `lab1_intake` | Builder sees valid `lab1_contract` JSON with `cited_sources` |
| 1:55 | Tools, MCP & integration (40) | MCP, approval workflows, OpenAPI, gateway; the three Fabric integration paths (Fabric IQ tool, OneLake as Foundry IQ source, ML `/score` endpoint). [Lab 3](content/labs/lab-03.md) walkthrough; activities MCP with approval. | `lab3_hazy_indoor_signup` | Approval card shown before `register_interest` |
| 2:35 | Break (15) | Helpers fix `.env` and sign-in issues for Builder. | — | — |
| 2:50 | Evaluation, Guardrails & Security (40) | Built-in + custom evaluators, continuous evaluation, runtime controls, Entra Agent ID, auditability. [Lab 2](content/labs/lab-02.md) walkthrough; compare two agent versions. | `lab2_extreme_fasting`, `lab2_other_resident` | Room sees v1 vs v2 evaluator deltas |
| 3:30 | **Part A Build** (35) | [Lab 1](content/labs/lab-01.md): attach the shared KB, add the JSON contract. | `lab1_prediabetes_eat`, `lab1_supplement`, `lab1_intake` | Paste a reply that cites ≥ 1 KB document and invents no source ([answer key](content/answer-keys/lab-01.json)) |
| 4:05 | **Part B Govern** (30) | [Lab 2](content/labs/lab-02.md): the seven-prompt guardrail ladder (default, then `livewell-guardrails`), trace, batch evaluation. | `lab2_extreme_fasting`, `lab2_medication_double`, `lab2_injected_flyer`, `lab2_other_resident`, `lab2_skip_meals`, `lab2_benign_control`, `lab2_benign_dose_reminder` | Flyer injection blocked or ignored **and** groundedness score pasted ([answer key](content/answer-keys/lab-02.json)) |
| 4:35 | **Part C Extend** (55) | See the Part C breakdown below. | | |

### Part C breakdown (4:35–5:30)

| Time | Beat | Who | Prompt(s) | Checkpoint |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4:35 | [Lab 3](content/labs/lab-03.md) core: profile tool, activities MCP with approval, memory, specialists | Everyone | `lab3_profile_tailored`, `lab3_hazy_indoor_signup`, `lab3_memory_set`, `lab3_memory_recall`, `lab3_specialists` | Compound question fires ≥ 2 tools/agents in the trace; reply fits Rahim's glucose; registration waits for approval ([answer key](content/answer-keys/lab-03.json)) |
| 5:05 | [Fabric step](content/labs/fabric-step.md) (only if `fabric_bridge: true` and the room is on time) | Everyone, or facilitator on screen | `fabric_q_disengaged_regions`, then `lab1_prediabetes_eat` | Trace shows the Fabric IQ call for Mei's question and the KB for Rahim's; region order matches `scripts/r360.py`; no `resident_id` |
| 5:15 | [Lab 4](content/labs/lab-04.md) demo: hosted agent with guardrails, called from curl | Facilitator | `lab4_week_plan_handoff`, `lab4_q_programmes_disengaged` | Endpoint returns valid JSON with a citation ([answer key](content/answer-keys/lab-04.json)) |
| 5:22 | [Bridge spotlight](content/labs/bridge-spotlight.md) + close on the ten patterns and the extended arc | Facilitator | `bridge_q_dropped_attended_heldin` (only if time) | — |

Timing rule: if the room is more than 10 minutes behind at 5:05, run the Fabric step on screen and play the
Lab 4 recording. The bridge spotlight is slides-only when the Fabric step ran live, and a full demo when it did not.

## Demo prompts by lab

| Lab | prompt_ids (in order) |
|---|---|
| 0 | `lab0_hi`, `lab0_am_i_diabetic` |
| 1 | `lab1_prediabetes_eat`, `lab1_supplement`, `lab1_activity_guideline`, `lab1_intake` |
| 2 | `lab2_extreme_fasting`, `lab2_medication_double`, `lab2_injected_flyer`, `lab2_other_resident`, `lab2_skip_meals`, `lab2_benign_control`, `lab2_benign_dose_reminder` |
| 3 | `lab3_profile_tailored`, `lab3_hazy_indoor_signup`, `lab3_memory_set`, `lab3_memory_recall`, `lab3_specialists` |
| Fabric step | `fabric_q_disengaged_regions` |
| 4 | `lab4_week_plan_handoff`, `lab4_q_programmes_disengaged` |
| Bridge | `bridge_q_dropped_attended_heldin` |

Scripted runs prepend the `consent_line` from the prompt bank so the Lab 0 consent rule does not stall them.

## Backup plans

| Failure | Backup |
|---|---|
| Sign-in / Authenticator / RBAC | Pair with a neighbour on a shared screen while an operator fixes access (`scripts/seed-attendees.sh` re-run) |
| Model quota (429 on `gpt-5-mini`) | Switch the agent to `gpt-4.1-mini` (no Reasoning effort setting) and carry on; the facilitator raises the TPM cap if the quota allows |
| Knowledge base missing or slow | Show the static guides in [content/knowledge/livewell-guides/](content/knowledge/livewell-guides/); Builder asserts on expected guide ids |
| Guardrail attach fails in the portal | Use the prebuilt `livewell-demo-guarded` agent for the red-flag contrast |
| Evaluators unavailable | Show the pre-captured evaluation run and trace from `demos/` |
| Activities MCP down | Run `content/assets/mcp-activities/server.py` locally behind a tunnel, or show the recorded approval trace |
| Fabric tool down, capacity paused, or data agent unpublished | Play the recorded Fabric-step answer; quote the region order from `python scripts/r360.py` |
| Portal glitch in general | Pre-recorded demo videos and screenshots in `demos/` and the [Portal Track](content/labs/PORTAL-TRACK.md) |

## RBAC gotchas

- **Foundry User** (participants): create and run agents, use shared deployments, the shared KB and shared connections.
  Cannot deploy models, create connections, or publish hosted agents.
- **Foundry Project Manager** (facilitator): everything above, plus connections and hosted deploy. Lab 4 is facilitator-only for this reason.
- The Fabric IQ tool uses identity passthrough: participants need **Viewer** (or read on the data agent) in the
  `HPB Resident 360` workspace, or the call fails with 403.
- Never delete agents with the `livewell-demo-` or `livewell-workshop-` prefix.

## After the day (T+1)

- Pause the Fabric capacity immediately after the session: `bash scripts/capacity.sh suspend <env>`.
- Run [`scripts/teardown.sh`](scripts/teardown.sh) once demos are archived. See the cost table in [ADMIN-SETUP](content/admin/ADMIN-SETUP.md).
