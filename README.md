# LiveWell Coach: Microsoft Foundry Workshop

### *A healthy-living coach for Singapore residents, built on Microsoft Foundry and extended with Fabric IQ*

A one-day, hands-on workshop for the Health Promotion Board. You build **LiveWell Coach**, an agent that
answers healthy-living questions from curated guides with citations, personalises on a synthetic
Resident 360 profile, signs residents up for activities with a human in the loop, and answers a
programme officer's population questions through the **Fabric data agent the cohort built in the Fabric
workshop**. Fabric built the Resident 360 that sees Rahim; today Foundry builds the coach that talks to him.

## 👉 Start here

**Everyone starts at Lab 0 and goes in order.** Pick a rail inside each lab; you can switch between labs.

| Lab | Title | What you build | Time |
|-----|-------|----------------|------|
| **▶ [Lab 0](content/labs/lab-00.md)** | Setup & first agent | `livewell-<initials>`: model + instructions on gpt-5-mini, a safe refusal and its trace | 15 min |
| [Lab 1](content/labs/lab-01.md) | Agents & Knowledge: Foundry IQ | Foundry IQ knowledge base, citations, JSON contract | 40 min |
| [Lab 2](content/labs/lab-02.md) | Guardrails, Evaluations & Tracing | RAI policy, four red-flag prompts, traces, batch evaluation, v1 vs v2 | 40 min |
| [Lab 3](content/labs/lab-03.md) | Tools, MCP & Memory: hyper-personalisation | Profile tool, activities MCP with approval, memory, specialists | 40 min |
| [Fabric step](content/labs/fabric-step.md) | Add the Fabric IQ tool (optional, in Lab 3) | Mei's region question answered by the Resident360 Ontology Agent | 15 min |
| [Lab 4](content/labs/lab-04.md) | Multi-agent & Hosted deploy *(browser hands-on + facilitator deploy)* | Agent Framework orchestration, hosted agent with guardrails | 30 min |
| [Bridge spotlight](content/labs/bridge-spotlight.md) | Two IQs, one agent *(facilitator)* | How the Fabric medallion and Foundry fit together | 10 min |

**Pick your rail** (every lab has 🟢 Navigator and 🔵 Builder sections):

| Rail | For | You work in | Setup needed |
|------|-----|-------------|--------------|
| 🟢 **Navigator** | Programme officers, IT leaders, anyone who prefers the browser | The **Foundry portal** | A browser and your workshop sign-in |
| 🔵 **Builder** | Developers, data engineers, technical PMs | Python scripts in `content/assets/` (cell form, open as notebooks) | Codespaces *(recommended)* or local Python |

> 🟢 **Navigator: you're done reading. [Start Lab 0](content/labs/lab-00.md).** Prefer screenshots? Use the [Portal Track](content/labs/PORTAL-TRACK.md).

> 🔵 **Builder: skim [Builder setup](#-builder-setup) below, then start Lab 0.**

### The ten agentic patterns in LiveWell

| # | Pattern | Lab | What you see |
|---|---------|-----|--------------|
| 1 | Multi-Document Understanding | 1 | Rahim's screening summary + activity diary → structured JSON intake |
| 2 | Evidence-Based Decision Support | 3 | `{advice, confidence, supporting_guides[], rationale, personalisation_flags[]}` |
| 3 | Workflow Orchestration | 3 / 4 | Coach orchestrator → Nutrition + Activity specialists |
| 4 | Knowledge Retrieval | 1 | Foundry IQ knowledge base; citations mandatory |
| 5 | Explainability & Traceability | 2 | Citations, traces, evaluator scores, monitoring |
| 6 | Human-in-the-Loop Review | 3 | Approval card before `register_interest` |
| 7 | Handling Uncertainty | 2 | Route to a clinician or HealthHub; never dose medication; "insufficient information" |
| 8 | Institutional Memory | 3 | Memory of stated preferences ("I prefer mornings") |
| 9 | Collaboration Between Specialists | 3 / 4 | Nutrition + Activity + Programme-Insights specialists, one merged reply |
| 10 | Governance & Safety | 2 + throughout | Guardrails, evaluators, red-team scan, RBAC, Entra Agent ID |

## Before the day

<details>
<summary><strong>Logistics for participants</strong></summary>

- **Bring a personal laptop.** WOG devices cannot sign in to an external Entra tenant.
- **Guest Wi-Fi:** SSID and code are on the welcome slide (set in `content/config/workshop.yaml`).
- **First sign-in:** you get a workshop account (`hpb.labNN@…`) and a temporary password. At first
  sign-in you change the password and register **Microsoft Authenticator** on your phone. Install it before the day.
- Use a private or guest browser window so your work account does not interfere.

</details>

## 🔵 Builder setup

Two things before Lab 1: a place to run Python (Codespaces or your laptop) and a filled-in `content/assets/.env`.
Do it during Lab 0 or before the day; `check_setup.py` tells you when you are ready.

<details>
<summary><strong>Option A · GitHub Codespaces (recommended, ~5 min)</strong></summary>

You need a GitHub account that can open this repository (the facilitator shares access before the day). The
dev container gives everyone the same Linux image: Python 3.13 in a `.venv` that is already active, uv, `az`,
`azd`, `fab`, Docker-in-Docker, and everything in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). Codespaces usage comes
out of your GitHub account's free monthly hours; the 2-core machine is enough.

1. On the repository page: **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**. The first build takes 3–5 minutes.
   Wait until the setup terminal finishes installing packages before you run anything.
2. Sign in to Azure in the Codespace terminal:

   ```bash
   az login --use-device-code --allow-no-subscriptions
   ```

   Open the link it prints in the **private browser window where you are signed in as `hpb.labNN`**, enter the
   code and pick that account. If it asks you to choose a subscription, press Enter.
3. Create your settings file, then fill it in (see [Your `.env`](#your-env) below):

   ```bash
   cp content/assets/.env.sample content/assets/.env
   code content/assets/.env
   ```

4. Check everything, and repeat until it ends with **All set: start Lab 1**:

   ```bash
   python content/assets/check_setup.py
   ```

5. Run a lab: `python content/assets/lab1_knowledge.py`, or open the file and click **Run Cell** above each
   `# %%`. If VS Code asks for a kernel, pick **Python Environments → .venv**.

The Codespace stops after 30 idle minutes. Reopen it from **github.com/codespaces**: your `.env`, sign-in and
files are kept. If `az` says your token expired, repeat step 2.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B · Local machine</strong></summary>

Needs Python 3.12 or 3.13, Git and the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
From the repository root:

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv ; .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"
az login --use-device-code --allow-no-subscriptions
Copy-Item content\assets\.env.sample content\assets\.env ; notepad content\assets\.env
python content\assets\check_setup.py
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
az login --use-device-code --allow-no-subscriptions
cp content/assets/.env.sample content/assets/.env && ${EDITOR:-nano} content/assets/.env
python content/assets/check_setup.py
```

Sign in as in Option A step 2. Activate `.venv` again in every new terminal. Windows on ARM: some wheels are
x64-only. Use an x64 Python, or Codespaces.

</details>

### Your `.env`

`content/assets/.env` is git-ignored and holds two values. Everything else is found by name in the project, so
there are no keys or passwords to copy.

| Line | What to put | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| `INITIALS=` | Your own initials, 2–8 letters or digits, e.g. `INITIALS=jt` | You. If you also do the portal steps, use the same initials as your Navigator agent `livewell-<initials>` |
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=` | `https://….services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/livewell-workshop` | The **Project endpoint** row on the facilitator values sheet. Copy the whole value |
| `FABRIC_BRIDGE=false` | Leave `false` | Set `true` only when the facilitator says the Fabric step is on |

The model names, the knowledge base and the tool connections (`livewell-guides-kb-mcp`,
`livewell-activities-mcp`, `livewell-fabric-resident360`) come from
[`workshop.yaml`](content/config/workshop.yaml) and the project. You do not set them. Because `.env` holds your
initials, every lab command is just `python content/assets/labN_….py`.

`check_setup.py` is read-only. It checks Python and the packages, your `.env`, your Azure sign-in, the project's
tool connections and the two model deployments, and prints what to fix:

| It says | Do this |
|---|---|
| `FIX no content/assets/.env` | Step 3 |
| `FIX Set INITIALS first` or `WARN INITIALS=abc` | Put your own initials in `.env` |
| `FIX FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT should look like…` | Copy the whole **Project endpoint** row again |
| `FIX not signed in to Azure` | Step 2 |
| `FIX your account cannot open this project` | Check the endpoint; otherwise ask a facilitator to grant your account **Foundry User** |
| `WARN not an hpb.labNN account` | You signed in with another account. Run `az logout`, then step 2 |
