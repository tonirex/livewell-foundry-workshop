# # Lab 4 - Multi-agent & Hosted deploy - Builder rail
#
# The coach becomes a team. Microsoft Agent Framework runs the orchestration on your machine and calls the
# project's model deployments directly, so these local agents run under the deployment's guardrail (the platform
# default, Microsoft.DefaultV2), not `livewell-guardrails`. The Foundry agents below (Programme-Insights, the
# hosted agent) carry `livewell-guardrails` themselves.
#
# * Two local specialists, Nutrition and Activity, with the same hosted tools as Lab 3: the knowledge-base
#   MCP endpoint and `find_activities` (never `register_interest`).
# * A SEQUENTIAL workflow: Nutrition -> Activity -> Coach. The Coach merges both answers into one evidence JSON.
# * A HAND-OFF workflow: the Coach triages, hands off to Nutrition, and Nutrition hands off to Activity.
# * A Programme-Insights specialist, `livewell-<INITIALS>-insights`: a Foundry agent with the Fabric IQ tool
#   for officer questions (with `--fabric`, only when the facilitator confirms FABRIC_BRIDGE=true).
# * A smoke test of the facilitator's hosted agent, `livewell-workshop-hosted`, once it is deployed.
#
# Run it all:  `INITIALS=abc python content/assets/lab4_multiagent.py`
# Flags:       `--fabric`, `--no-handoff`, `--verbose` (each agent's full answer), `--cleanup`.
#
# Lines marked `# 👉` are the ones to retype during the lab.
