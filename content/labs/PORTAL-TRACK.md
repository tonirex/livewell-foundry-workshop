# LiveWell Coach — Portal track (🟢 Navigator)

This portal-only track is for 🟢 Navigator participants who want a click-by-click, screenshot-led path through the workshop. You will use the Microsoft Foundry portal only: no code, no terminal, no SDK, and no notebooks.

Screenshots come from the live portal, captured with Playwright by `demos/capture-screenshots.py` (facilitator demo agents, names only). A step whose screenshot exists shows it as an image. A step still waiting for one keeps a text-only screenshot slot, so link checkers never fail.

## Naming rules

Your portal agent is `livewell-<initials>` and is reused from Lab 0 through Lab 3. Use your own initials, keep the name short, and never touch facilitator demo agents named `livewell-demo-*` or protected workshop agents named `livewell-workshop-*`.

## Screenshot slot convention

Each lab step has a screenshot slot in this exact format:

> 📸 **Screenshot slot** · `screenshots/lab-01/03-connect-foundry-iq.png` · Knowledge panel with livewell-guides-kb selected

Once its PNG exists, `python demos/capture-screenshots.py --link` rewrites the slot as `![caption](path)`. The capture still finds linked slots by their path, so re-capturing after a portal change needs no edits.

Rules for screenshot authors:

- Keep screenshot paths relative to `content/labs/`.
- Use `screenshots/lab-0N/NN-short-slug.png`.
- Convert a slot to an image only after reviewing its PNG against the caption; `--link` converts only slots whose PNG exists.
- `python demos/capture-screenshots.py --list-missing` lists empty slots, including the ones taken by hand with a lab account.
- Capture only names shown in [workshop.yaml](../config/workshop.yaml), never tenant IDs, subscription IDs, endpoints, keys, or real email domains.
