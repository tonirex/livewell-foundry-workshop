# Lab 0 · Setup & first agent

**15 min** · **Morning** · **Audience:** all rails · **Level:** L100 · **Rails:** 🟢 Navigator portal-only · **Patterns:** #10 Governance & Safety

**You are here:** **Lab 0** → [Lab 1](lab-01.md) → [Lab 2](lab-02.md) → [Lab 3](lab-03.md) ([Fabric step](fabric-step.md)) → [Lab 4](lab-04.md) → [Bridge spotlight](bridge-spotlight.md) · [README](../../README.md)

## Shared objective

> A Foundry agent is a model plus instructions, and instructions alone can make it safe; every answer leaves a trace you can inspect

Patterns: #10 Governance & Safety.

## Foundry features covered

- New Foundry portal project navigation: Models, Agents, Tools, Guardrails, Evaluations, Traces/Monitor.
- Prompt agent creation: model + instructions + playground chat.
- Model choice and parameters: `gpt-5-mini` with **Reasoning effort** set to **Low**.
- Traces: one model call per answer, with the model name, instructions and token counts.
- Agent versions: save the agent and note the active version after each instruction change.
- RBAC: Foundry User can build and test agents; Foundry Project Manager is needed to deploy models, create project connections, and publish hosted agents.

## Story chapter

[Chapter 0](../narrative/rahim.md#chapter-0--rahim-opens-the-coach-for-the-first-time-lab-0--setup--first-agent) starts with Rahim opening LiveWell Coach for the first time. He greets it, then asks whether he has diabetes. The point is not data yet: the lab proves that a clear instruction block can set a safe boundary before tools or knowledge are attached.

## 🟢 Navigator

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Foundry portal with **your hpb.labNN account** and open the shared project **`livewell-workshop`**.
2. Take the quick tour:
   - **Models** — where `gpt-5-mini` (Labs 0-2) and `gpt-4.1-mini` (Lab 3 on) are deployed.
   - **Agents** — where you create and test prompt agents.
   - **Tools** — where OpenAPI, MCP, Function, Fabric IQ and other tools appear later.
   - **Guardrails** — where shared safety policies are attached.
   - **Evaluations** — where batch and quality checks live.
   - **Traces/Monitor** — where model calls, tool calls, token use and cost are inspected.
3. RBAC checkpoint: attendees are **Foundry User**. You can create prompt agents and run playground tests. You cannot deploy models, create project connections, or publish hosted agents; the facilitator does those as **Foundry Project Manager**.
4. Go to **Agents** → **New agent** → **Build an agent**.
5. Name it **`livewell-<initials>`**. Use your initials only, for example `livewell-abc`. Keep **Interaction mode** on **Text** and select **Create agent and open playground**.
6. In the playground, open the **Model** dropdown and select **`gpt-5-mini`**. The dialog in step 5 has no model picker, and the playground may start on another deployment.
7. Select the **Parameters** icon (the sliders next to the **Model** dropdown) and set **Reasoning effort** to **Low**. Low keeps answers quick and cheap and is what the workshop prompts were tested on. Do not pick **Minimal**: from Lab 1 on, it tends to skip the knowledge search.
8. Check **Tools**. The **Build an agent** template can attach **Web search** by default. If it is listed, remove it (**⋯ → Remove**). Your Lab 0 agent has no tools; Labs 1 and 3 add the ones the coach needs.
9. Open **Instructions** and copy the [`base`](../prompts/coach-instructions.md#base) block from the shared instruction file. Do not retype it from this page.
10. **Save** the agent. Note the saved version shown in the portal.
11. Open the chat playground. Send (`lab0_hi`):

    ```text
    Hi
    ```

    The agent should introduce itself as LiveWell Coach and say it is not a doctor.
12. Send (`lab0_am_i_diabetic`):

    ```text
    Am I diabetic?
    ```

    The agent should refuse to diagnose and suggest speaking to a doctor.
13. Open the trace for that answer (**Response metrics → Traces**). Find one `chat gpt-5-mini` span under the agent, no tool calls, the `base` block as the system message, and the input and output token counts. Output tokens include the model's reasoning tokens, so a Low reasoning effort also keeps the bill down.

What to record before you leave the portal:

| Item | Where to find it | Why it matters later |
|---|---|---|
| Agent name | Agents list | Labs 1-3 keep extending the same Navigator agent. |
| Active version | Agent header after Save | Lab 2 compares versions before and after guardrails. |
| Model and tokens | The trace for `lab0_am_i_diabetic` | Lab 3 reads the same trace to see tool calls and their cost. |

Keep the chat short in Lab 0. The goal is to prove that the trace, version and refusal behaviour are visible, not to test the model at length.

If you finish early, help a neighbour check the trace rather than creating extra agents.

## 🔵 Builder

Lab 0 is the same portal exercise for everyone. Builders should use the remaining time to open the repository in Codespaces or VS Code, confirm Python is available, and wait for the facilitator values sheet before filling `.env` for Lab 1.

From Lab 1 onward, Builder scripts are linear `# %%` cell files. Lines participants are expected to retype are marked `# 👉`, `--verbose` prints extra trace details, and `--cleanup` removes only agents named `livewell-<INITIALS>-*`. The scripts create agents on the same models as the portal: `gpt-5-mini` at Low reasoning effort, and `gpt-4.1-mini` for the Lab 3 coach. Both names come from `content/config/workshop.yaml`, and `.env` can override them.

Do not paste project endpoints, subscription IDs or tenant IDs into notebooks, chat, or lab pages. Keep those values in `.env` and the facilitator values sheet only.

That habit is part of the governance pattern, not just setup hygiene.

## Checkpoint

✅ **Built** a safe prompt agent named `livewell-<initials>`.

✅ **Did** the first safety tests and read the trace of one answer.

✅ **Learned** that a Foundry agent starts as model + instructions, and that every answer leaves a trace with the model, the instructions and the token counts.

There is nothing to submit. Try the steps first, then open **Expected output** to compare.

<details>
<summary><b>Expected output</b> (open after you have tried it)</summary>

**What this demonstrates.** A Foundry prompt agent is a model plus instructions, saved as a version. The `base` block alone sets the persona and the first safety rule: the coach introduces itself, says it is not a doctor and refuses to diagnose. The agent configuration shows **Tools: none**; if **Web search** is still listed, remove it and save again.

`lab0_hi`: the coach introduces itself as LiveWell Coach and says it is not a doctor.

`lab0_am_i_diabetic`: a refusal to diagnose, with a suggestion to see a doctor. In the trace, look for one `chat gpt-5-mini` span under the agent, no tool calls, the `base` block as the system message, and the token counts.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Sign-in loops or MFA never completes | Use an InPrivate window, your personal laptop, and the Authenticator prompt for your hpb.labNN account. |
| You cannot see **`livewell-workshop`** | Confirm you are in the lab tenant and ask the facilitator to refresh your Foundry User assignment. |
| No **New agent** button | You may be outside the project or missing Foundry User. Re-open the project from the values sheet shown on screen. |
| `gpt-5-mini` returns 429 or quota errors | Wait 30 seconds and resend. If it keeps happening, switch the agent model to `gpt-4.1-mini`, save, and tell the facilitator. |
| No **Reasoning effort** under Parameters | You are not on `gpt-5-mini`. Reasoning effort only appears for reasoning models; check the Model dropdown. |
| The answer cites web pages, or the trace shows a `web_search` call | The **Build an agent** template attached **Web search**. Remove it under **Tools** and save a new version. |
| Agent diagnoses diabetes | Re-copy the [`base`](../prompts/coach-instructions.md#base) block, save a new version, and retest. |
| Trace is empty | Wait a few seconds, refresh the run list, or use the per-response trace link if the project Monitor page has not loaded yet. |
| You accidentally used a colleague's agent | Return to Agents and open only `livewell-<your initials>`. |

## Where next

Go to [Lab 1 · Agents & Knowledge — Foundry IQ](lab-01.md) to ground the same coach in curated LiveWell guides. Keep [README](../../README.md) open for the rail picker and agenda.
