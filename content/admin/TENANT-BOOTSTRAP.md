# TENANT-BOOTSTRAP — delivering in the sponsored subscription's tenant

The delivery subscription (Azure sponsorship) lives in a **different Entra tenant** from the MCAPS dry-run
environment. This runbook takes an empty tenant to a green `sponsor` environment (SPEC.md §12.2). Everything
carries over from the dry run except GUIDs, RBAC, lab accounts and tenant settings, which scripts or this page
re-create.

## Step 0: can we skip all of this?

First check whether the sponsorship offer allows the Azure **Change directory** transfer into the MCAPS tenant.
If it does, the subscription joins the tenant where the dry run already works, and this runbook is unnecessary:
use `infra/env/mcaps.bicepparam` settings with the sponsor subscription ID.

1. Azure portal → **Subscriptions** → the sponsorship subscription → **Overview** → **Change directory**.
2. The **subscription Owner** starts the transfer. An **Entra admin in the destination tenant** must accept it.
3. **Restrictions:** CSP subscriptions are excluded. Every Azure role assignment is lost and must be re-created;
   `scripts/provision.sh` and `scripts/seed-attendees.sh` do that. Managed identities are re-created by the template.
4. If the button is greyed out, or the offer type says it is not supported, continue with Step 1.

Record the outcome in [ASSUMPTIONS.md](../../ASSUMPTIONS.md) under "Values Antonia must supply".

## Step 1: admin roles and tenant basics

| Check | How | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| You are **Global Administrator** (or hold **Fabric Administrator** + **User Administrator**) | Entra admin centre → Roles & admins → My roles | Tenant settings, lab accounts |
| Tenant country/region is **Singapore** | Entra admin centre → Overview → Properties | Data residency statement, lab-account usage location |
| The facilitator account is a **member** (not a guest) of this tenant | Entra → Users → user type = Member | Fabric capacity admin must be a member UPN |
| The facilitator is a **work or school** account, not a personal Microsoft account | Entra → Users: the UPN ends in the tenant's domain, without `#EXT#` | ARM cannot create the Fabric capacity for a personal account ("Unable to authorize with Azure Active Directory") |
| Security defaults are **on** | Entra → Overview → Properties → Manage security defaults | MFA for lab accounts without Entra P1 |
| The facilitator has a Fabric licence | Sign in once at https://app.fabric.microsoft.com (the Free licence is assigned on first sign-in) | Fabric REST / `fab` calls (otherwise `UserNotLicensed`) |

A sponsorship subscription created with an outlook.com address comes with a tenant whose only user is that personal
account. Create a cloud-only facilitator in it (Entra → Users → New user, `<name>@<tenant>.onmicrosoft.com`), make
it Global Administrator and Owner on the subscription, and run every step below as that account.

Put the facilitator UPN(s) into [workshop.yaml](../config/workshop.yaml) `environments.sponsor.facilitator_upns`, and into
`fabricAdminMembers` and `budgetContactEmails` in `infra/env/sponsor.bicepparam`. A cloud-only account has no
mailbox, so send the budget alerts to an address someone reads. Put the subscription and tenant IDs into
`environments.sponsor`.

## Fabric tenant settings

Fabric admin portal (app.fabric.microsoft.com → Settings → Admin portal → **Tenant settings**). Scope each setting to a
security group (for example `sg-livewell-workshop` containing the facilitators and lab accounts) rather than the whole
organisation, except where noted.

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Users can create Fabric items | Enabled (group) | Lakehouse, notebook, ontology, data agent |
| Users can create Ontology (preview) items | Enabled (group) | `resident_ontology`. Formerly "Enable Ontology item (preview)"; without it `30-ontology.py` gets 403 `FeatureNotAvailable` |
| Fabric data agent | Enabled (group) | `Resident360 Ontology Agent` |
| Users can use Copilot and other features powered by Azure OpenAI | Enabled (group) | Data agent runtime |
| Data sent to Azure OpenAI can be processed outside your capacity's geographic region… | Enabled | Enable even though Sweden Central is in the EU |
| Data sent to Azure OpenAI can be stored outside your capacity's geographic region… | Enabled | Same |
| Service principals can use Fabric APIs | Enabled (group) | Automation fallback; runtime still uses user identity |
| Create workspaces | Enabled for the **facilitator group only** | Attendees do not create workspaces |

Allow up to **one hour** for the settings to propagate before running `scripts/fabric/deploy.sh`.
`bash scripts/preflight.sh sponsor` (check 8) reads the tenant settings through the Fabric admin API.

## Step 2: Azure subscription preparation

`az` and `azd` keep one sign-in and one default subscription per user, shared by every terminal. To keep the two
environments apart, give the sponsor tenant its own profile folders. A terminal with the three variables below works
only on sponsor; every other terminal stays on MCAPS, and neither changes the other's sign-in.

```bash
# Every sponsor terminal (Git Bash). PowerShell: $env:AZURE_CONFIG_DIR = "$HOME\.azure-livewell-sponsor" and so on.
export AZURE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.azure-livewell-sponsor"   # az sign-in and default subscription
export AZURE_EXTENSION_DIR="$HOME/.azure/cliextensions"   # reuse the az extensions already installed
export AZD_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.azd-livewell-sponsor"       # azd settings and extensions

# Once
az login --tenant <sponsor-tenant-id>
azd config set auth.useAzCliAuth true       # azd uses the az sign-in above
azd extension install azure.ai.agents
azd env new sponsor --subscription <sponsor-subscription-id> --location swedencentral
azd env set SEARCH_LOCATION francecentral   # as on mcaps: no new Search capacity in swedencentral (ASSUMPTIONS 2.5)
bash scripts/preflight.sh sponsor           # registers resource providers; prints quota links for any FAIL
```

The azd environment itself (`.azure/sponsor/`) is gitignored and lives only in the checkout that created it.

On a fresh subscription, expect to request:

- **Fabric capacity units:** 2 CU in `swedencentral`. This is often 0 on a new subscription. The Fabric trial is refused;
  the workshop needs a paid F2 or larger.
- **Foundry model quota** in `swedencentral`, Global Standard: `gpt-5-mini` 400K TPM, `gpt-4.1-mini` 200K TPM
  (Lab 3 coach on), `text-embedding-3-small` 100K TPM. The sponsorship subscription's Tier 0 limits (500K, 200K and
  1M) already cover this for 6 participants; delete any test deployments of these models first.

Lead time for quota can be several business days. Start this at T-10 (see [ADMIN-SETUP.md](ADMIN-SETUP.md#t-10-quota-requests)).

## Step 3: lab accounts

```bash
bash scripts/tenant/create-lab-users.sh sponsor --dry-run    # shows hpb.lab01 … hpb.lab20 + hpb.breakglass
bash scripts/tenant/create-lab-users.sh sponsor
```

- The script creates 20 cloud-only accounts `hpb.lab01`…`hpb.lab20` on the tenant's default domain, with usage
  location **SG** and a temporary password. The password must be changed at first sign-in, when security defaults
  also force Authenticator registration.
- It also creates a **break-glass** account `hpb.breakglass`: Global Administrator, no forced password change. Exclude
  it from any Conditional Access policy and keep its password offline.
- Temporary passwords are written to `.azure/sponsor/lab-accounts.csv`, which is gitignored and never printed. Print one card
  per account with `python scripts/tenant/sign-in-cards.py sponsor --lab-accounts` (A4 PDF in the same gitignored
  folder). Personal laptops only: WOG devices cannot sign in to an external tenant.
- Re-running is safe. Use `--reset-passwords` to issue new passwords, or `--delete` after the workshop.
- **Named accounts instead** (the 2026 delivery, ASSUMPTIONS.md 10.8): create one cloud-only member per participant
  (`firstname.lastname@<tenant>`, usage location SG, password changed at first sign-in), assign each the free
  Microsoft Fabric licence, put their UPNs in `attendees.txt` (gitignored, one per line) and run
  `bash scripts/seed-attendees.sh sponsor --file attendees.txt` after the Fabric deploy. Every member can already
  register applications (service principals). Creating Azure resources needs an Azure role: Owner on their own
  resource group is the safe choice; Owner on the subscription also lets them change the shared workshop resources.
  Set `lab_accounts.naming: named` in `workshop.yaml` so the values sheet describes them, and print their cards with
  `python scripts/tenant/sign-in-cards.py sponsor --file attendees.txt` (asks for the shared temporary password).

## Step 4: build and prove the sponsor environment

Same sequence as the dry run ([ADMIN-SETUP.md → T-3](ADMIN-SETUP.md#t-3-build-the-environment)), in a sponsor
terminal (Step 2):

```bash
bash scripts/provision.sh sponsor --what-if       # capacity admins = member UPNs in THIS tenant
bash scripts/cost-guardrails.sh sponsor
# fab keeps one sign-in per user (~/.config/fab), so give it the sponsor az sign-in's tokens instead of
# `fab auth login`; they last about an hour, so export them again before a long run.
export FAB_TOKEN="$(az account get-access-token --resource https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api --query accessToken -o tsv)"
export FAB_TOKEN_ONELAKE="$(az account get-access-token --resource https://storage.azure.com --query accessToken -o tsv)"
export FAB_TOKEN_AZURE="$(az account get-access-token --resource https://management.azure.com --query accessToken -o tsv)"
bash scripts/fabric/deploy.sh sponsor             # Phase 3
# Fabric IQ connection: portal runbook step (content/labs/fabric-step.md), needs Foundry Project Manager
bash scripts/seed-attendees.sh sponsor --lab-accounts
python scripts/smoke-test.py && python scripts/validate-narrative.py
bash scripts/capacity.sh suspend sponsor
```

Then run a **full second dry run** with a lab account in a private browser window.
